&lt;h1&gt;PUTAIN&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years of reading, searching and thinking, I finally decided for my graduation project to make a film about prostitution. One year later, this 5 minutes short was born.
&lt;img alt="image01" src="images/putain/affiche_putain.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ORIGINS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then the issue of prostitution is all over the medias, and the discussions are always the same : should it be legal ? Who is to blame for this ? How to save prostitutes from prostitution ?
And I was listening to these debates, but with other questions in mind. I wanted to know why some people feel like going to prostitutes for sex ? What is really exchanged during the relationship between a client and a prostitute ? What is sold and what is bought ? Is it really a body ? Sex ? Love ? Tenderness ? Violence ? A getaway ? All of that ?
And I had this feeling that prostitution might take a bigger part in our society than it looks.
It seemed obvious that is not a simple legal matter, but a social issue that deserves to be studied and explored without any judgment but the will to understand.
&lt;img alt="image01" src="images/putain/visuel_HD_01.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="image02" src="images/putain/visuel_HD_02.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="image03" src="images/putain/visuel_HD_03.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="image04" src="images/putain/visuel_HD_04.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="image05" src="images/putain/visuel_HD_05.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;INTENTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring this issue, and working for four months with the association &lt;a href="https://www.entre2.org/"&gt;Entre 2&lt;/a&gt; that is helping prostitutes in their daily life, I discovered a very complex world that could not, of course, be described in 5 minutes. My first idea of making a documentary out of this matter fell apart quickly, considering the limited time I was given to animate and finish the film.
This is why I concentrated on giving a sensitive and intimate approach on prostitution. Inspired by stories I have been told, or I have red, I tried to represent some ways that prostitutes bodies are involved, how they feel in their daily life, how they apprehend this particular work they do.
My goal was not to give any personal opinions in this movie, nor to make some « shock-statement » about prostitution, to denounce or accuse anything or anyone. I wanted to share with the audience a more sensitive approach of the problem, to invite people to look at it like I do, with questions and tenderness. Whether it is clients or prostitutes, it is human beings we are talking about.
All in all, I tried to make a delicate film.

&lt;img alt="sketch02" src="images/putain/plan_veine.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="sketch03" src="images/putain/plan_marche.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ANIMATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using animation felt like the right media to do that, as it allowed me to put a distance with reality. Therefore I am not telling someone's story, but showing generic situations that concerns more than one person in particular. Also as there are no limits in what I could do and transform bodies and backgrounds, I was able to build complex metaphors and images to evoke things, more than showing them. Using bright and vivid colors helped to create a shift with the gravity of the subject.
And finally animation is all about movement, and I wanted to study ways of walking, undressing, waiting...

&lt;p&gt;When my friend &lt;a href="https://www.amaury-vdb.com/"&gt;Amaury Vanderborght&lt;/a&gt;, acrobat, came to me with this idea, I was thrilled !
He was working on the theme of collective and intimate memory, and wanted to explore this subject in a visual way, beside the show he is preparing in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ceux qui restent" is an ongoing documentary project, using different mediums. Whether it is visual arts, cinema, acrobatics that we use, the core is always testimonies of old people. We want to collect and transform this fragile individual memories, that are meant to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Film &amp;amp; Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In november 2016, we did a workshop in Paris with Maif Social Club. The result is a short film. Here is the trailer !

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the "Match" exposition at Bozar on may 7th 2016, we presented  a first installation version. As a film of different testimonies was screened, I was drawing on top of the projection using tracing paper and ink, and Amaury  was retyping what was said in the film. The result was a room filled in papers, quotes and drawings.
It was a first draft, and we were not satisfied with it. The search continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a detour by art theory and critic in Paris, I continued my studies in animated films at ENSAV La Cambre in Brussels, where I obtained my Master degree in 2015. While my graduation film "putain" travels festivals around the world, I try to transport my practice of drawn movement to different fields, such as performing arts, robotic and video. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>nomination 2016</title><link href="http://cypriadonato.work/nomination-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-19T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-09-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Cypria Donato</name></author><id>tag:cypriadonato.work,2016-09-19:nomination-2016.html</id><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title>ÉPHÉMÈRE</title><link href="http://cypriadonato.work/ephemere.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Cypria Donato</name></author><id>tag:cypriadonato.work,2014-04-01:ephemere.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;ÉPHÉMÈRE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Ngombengombe, dancer, came to me with the will to make a short piece together, mixing dance and animation/video, right after his studies at P.A.R.T.S. Still in my first master year, I wanted to test and experiment lots of things, so I agreed in making the video part in this piece.
&lt;img alt="image01" class="half" src="images/Ephemere/danse_cerf.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;img alt="affiche" class="full" src="images/Ephemere/ephemere_affiche.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation had a different purpose here than in my first try two years earlier. It had a more illustrative, less interactive role. Charles wanted to talk about human and nature in « Éphémère », and I tried my best during four months to accompany this subject in a visual way.
I also did the editing of the performance, of which you can see here an extract.

&lt;h2&gt;ANIMATION &amp;amp; EDITING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer 2012 : bachelor graduation was ahead and I was wondering what should I make for this special year. 
When I first began animation, I was discovering contemporary dance and circus at the same time. For me, animation was all about movements. But studying animation, I came to realize that it is a very complex media, including in its process so much different disciplines. Like drawing, which was my first passion, but also cinema. For so many people, animation is a cinema genre. As I totally disagree with that view, still cinematographic techniques are an important part of the animation process.
And the one thing that I love the most about cinema, is editing. So I started working on that, editing, assembling, confronting lots of videos, that I shot or found.
&lt;img alt="still01" class="half" src="images/JeanFloreEtc/extrait2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="still02" class="half" src="images/JeanFloreEtc/extrait3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="research01" class="full" src="images/JeanFloreEtc/recherche_flore.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="research02" class="full" src="images/JeanFloreEtc/recherche_jean.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MUSIC &amp;amp; STORY-TELLING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my friend had a song he wanted illustrated, and I liked this song a lot, we were talking about making a clip for it for a while. Putting images on top of music was the best editing exercise I could think of, so this is how it started.
It was really challenging and enjoyable to mix animation with live action, especially as the song is about how we always tell the same stories about love and life, and question fiction and reality.
So animation is used as the place of fiction, and illustrates what is happening between the characters. The videos come in between as symbolic images of their feelings and emotions, but those emotions are what is real about this fictional story. It is the purpose of every story ever to tell and think about universal feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SET &amp;amp; STOP-MOTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the background I had the idea of wheel spinning city, but I didn't want it to be digital. I wanted to feel some texture, some fragility also, something "handmade". And most of all, some little lights that could illuminate the night scenes.
I had the help of my friend Florent for the electric installation, and of &lt;a href="http://ddc-pagaille.tumblr.com/"&gt;David Chambolle&lt;/a&gt;, scenograph and animator, for the set design and building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for the set
&lt;img alt="plan01" class="full" src="images/JeanFloreEtc/décor.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my second year in school, I made my first transmedia experiment, working with both animation and acrobatics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this idea that we could extend the possibility of reality by considering animation as a character, living and interacting on the stage. And most of all, that we could extend the possibility of animation, forcing it into the real world, giving it some more weight, some more existence. As the real acrobat is limited in what his body can do, and the animation is free to move and transform completly freely, in the same time the acrobat has the whole world to perform in and explore, whereas the animation is bond to the screen limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Aurélien Oudot, dancer and acrobat, we do a similar work in the end : we use movement to express different feelings and ideas. In « Possible », we wanted to tell a story of how much it is pleasurable to explore the infinite possibilities of moving through space, whether it is real or virtual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this exercise is kind of clumsy, not quite what we wanted, Aurélien was wounded in the middle of our work, I was still new to animation, things didn't go as planned. But we were happy to try this, and to take a step further in the seizure of our respective medium.&lt;/p&gt;
