Summary:

# ÉPHÉMÈRE
Charles Ngombengombe, a dancer, asked me to make a short piece with him, mixing dance and animation/video, just after he finished studiying at P.A.R.T.S. This was during the first year of my Masters degree, so I wanted to test and try out lots of formats, so I accepted to make the video portion of this piece.

The animation had a different purpose here than in my first try two years earlier. It had a more illustrative, less interactive role. Charles wanted to talk about the human and nature in « Éphémère ». I tried my best to support this subject in a visual way during the four months of the project.
I also did the editing of the performance, of which you can see here an extract.
