# CEUX QUI RESTENT – THOSE WHO REMAINS
When my friend [Amaury Vanderborght](https://www.amaury-vdb.com/), acrobat, came to me with this idea, I was thrilled ! 
He was working on the theme of memory, collective and intimate memory, and wanted to explore this subject in a visual way, beside the show he is preparing in 2017.

"Ceux qui restent" is an ongoing documentary project, using different mediums. Whether it is visual arts, cinema, acrobatics that we use, the core is always testimonies of old people. We want to collect and transform this fragile individual memories, that are meant to disappear.

## Installation
During the "Match" exposition at Bozar on may 7th 2016, we presented  a first installation version. As a film of different testimonies was screened, I was drawing on top using tracing paper and ink, and Amaury  was retyping what was said in the film. The result was a room filled in papers, quotes and drawings.
It was a first draft, and we were not satisfied with it. The search continues.
